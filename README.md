# EDA_SOFA-Biostatistic
Our project aims to analyze a dataset concerning elderly patients. The first phase of the project was devoted to data cleaning and processing, in order to make the dataset usable for the next stages of the analysis.
Next, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed in order to identify any trends or correlations among the variables in the dataset. This phase allowed us to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of the elderly patients in question and to identify the most significant variables.
Finally, a survival analysis was performed in order to assess the relationship between the variables in the dataset and patient survival.
